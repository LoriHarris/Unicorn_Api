Three observable trends:

Though not a trend, I did observe some outliers when running the api calls.  
An error in finormation was found for Paita, where the humidity was listed as 
the temperature and max temperature, making humidity nearly 300%.

As for trends:

1) 
Humidity levels ranged up to 100% for all latitudes except those over 75 and under -50.
The closer to 0 the lattitude, the closer the humidity would hug the 100% line.
However, humidity readings up to 100% were still frequent until the latitude hit an extreme.

2) 
Wind speeds were varied, however, similar to the humidity trends, when the latitude hit an extreme, so did the wind speed.
Also noted, lower wind speeds were more frequently recorded in the latitude ranges from 0 to 75.
Again, wind speeds were still quite varied regardless of latitude.

3) 
Max temperature was the only graph I felt showed a true and visual change based on latitude.
You can see in this plot that the max temp is closesly tied to the latitude.
The plots are bundled closely and follow a distince curve of being higher near zero, lower as you move away from 0.
